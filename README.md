During my acadamics along electrical subjects i had a couple of programming subject in my first year as well in later year of my Acadamics. Python programming was one such elective subject in my academics which grabbed my interest in programming. on a go i started learning about java programming, HTML, CSS and a basics of computer networks.

I'm a fresh engineering graduate who constanstly tries to build my knowledge in various fields. As i went through the job description i think i would be a match to the job profile as i possess knowledge on HTML, CSS and python. Apart from being match to the profile if i could get a chance to a part of your organization it would be great oppurtunity for me to build my knowledge in software feild. As I have done a couple of certifications on HTML and CSS understanding and working ahead wouldn't be problem for me. I'm always eager to learn about new things.

I look foward to putting my knowledge and skills to use as a productive member of your IT department, and learning from the best in the industry. I assure you that i'll put my best foot forward and conform with the team.
